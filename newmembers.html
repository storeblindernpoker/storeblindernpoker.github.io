      We are a newly founded student association based at the University 
      of Oslo. Store Blindern Poker is a welcoming space for players of 
      all levels to learn, play, and enjoy poker together. All students 
      are welcome, no prior knowledge is necessary to join! We do our best 
      to help new members get familiar with the game and improve over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our main activity is a weekly 2-hour Texas Hold'em session held 
      every Friday. The sessions are part of a semester-long tournament, 
      resulting in a final table where players battle it out for the 
      title of Oslo’s best student poker player. Our tournament setup 
      makes it possible for new players to join anytime throughout the 
      semester. Missing one or several sessions is never an issue, but 
      regular attendance is rewarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking ahead we hope to build upon this by arranging more social 
      gatherings, one-shot tournaments, and other events to bring members 
      together outside of the weekly sessions.
