      We are a young poker association based at UiO Blindern, 
      created as a place where both new and experienced players 
      can meet, learn, and enjoy the game of poker together. 
      You don't need any prior knowledge to join, everyone is 
      welcome, and we do our best to help new members get 
      familiar with the game and improve over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our main activity is a weekly Texas Hold'em tournament, 
      held every Friday. We use a tournament-style system where 
      all players start with the same amount of chips, no matter 
      when in the semester they join. Each game usually lasts a 
      couple of hours and provides a great mix of competition 
      and fun.
  
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking ahead, we hope to build on this by arranging 
     more social gatherings, one-shot tournaments, and other 
     events that bring members together outside of the weekly 
     games.
